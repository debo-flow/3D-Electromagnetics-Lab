# 3D Electromagnetics & Antenna Radiation Laboratory

A comprehensive 3D Electromagnetic wave propagation simulator built with Python, Numba, and Streamlit. This laboratory uses the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method to solve Maxwell's curl equations, allowing users to visualize EM wave propagation, antenna radiation, and virtual anechoic environments.

## Milestone 1 — 3D FDTD Electromagnetic Wave Propagation
Implemented a robust 3D FDTD solver on a Yee-grid. Includes basic numerical boundaries (PEC), Gaussian source injection, CFL stability control, memory protection, and PyVista-based 3D visualization.

## Milestone 2 — PML Absorbing Boundary (Virtual Anechoic Environment)
Replaced basic PEC boundaries with Convolutional Perfectly Matched Layers (CPML). 

## Milestone 3 — Half-Wave Dipole Antenna
Introduces the first physical antenna into the electromagnetic laboratory: a center-fed half-wave dipole.

## Milestone 4 — Near-Field Electromagnetic Analysis
Introduces quantitative near-field sampling, frequency-domain analysis, and energy-flow calculations directly from the FDTD grid.

## Milestone 5 — Near-to-Far-Field Transformation (NF2FF)
Implements a scientifically rigorous transformation of sampled near-field data into an estimated far-field electromagnetic solution based on the equivalence principle.

## Milestone 6 — 3D Antenna Radiation Pattern
Converts the validated NF2FF transformation data into a complete 3D angular antenna radiation pattern.

## Milestone 7 — Gain, Directivity & Efficiency
Introduces quantitative antenna performance metrics natively via 2D spherical solid-angle evaluations over the Far-Field limits.

## Milestone 8 — Rectangular Microstrip Patch Antenna
Replaces wire-antenna modeling with complex planar structures featuring dielectrics, vertical lumped feeds, and finite ground boundaries.

## Milestone 9 — Advanced Electromagnetic Materials
Generalizes the FDTD kernel to evaluate wave propagation through spatially varying environments ($\epsilon_r, \mu_r, \sigma$).

## Milestone 10 — GPU Accelerated FDTD Engine
Accelerates the immensely computation-heavy 3D FDTD loop using array-based vectorization strictly parallelized across GPU hardware frameworks.

## Milestone 11 — Advanced Numerical Validation & Benchmarking
Transforms the existing validation system into a rigorous, reproducible numerical verification framework to prove the mathematical integrity of the FDTD kernel.

## Milestone 12 — Dispersive Electromagnetic Materials
Extends the material system utilizing an Auxiliary Differential Equation (ADE) Debye model integrated continuously into Ampere's law.

## Milestone 13 — Anisotropic Electromagnetic Materials
Extends the material system to support diagonal tensor permittivity matrices ($\varepsilon̿$), enabling mathematically rigorous direction-dependent wave propagation.

## Milestone 14 — Antenna Arrays & Beamforming
Upgrades the simulation architecture to support Uniform Linear Arrays (ULA) and electronic Beam Steering.

## Milestone 15 — Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)
Introduces a block-structured static Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) algorithm. 
* **Static Block AMR:** The solver dynamically superimposes a high-resolution subgrid (2:1 spatial refinement ratio) centrally positioned over complex geometry regions (e.g., the antenna feed). 
* **2-Way Coarse-Fine Coupling:** Operates mathematically through rigorous bidirectional spatial interpolation. The coarse grid's boundary conditions are passed continuously to the subgrid edge, and the resultant high-resolution subgrid volumetric updates are systematically averaged (restricted) back into the coarse grid.
* **Accuracy and CFL Considerations:** Demonstrates massive computational memory reduction ($\approx 4\times$) against executing a uniform fine-grid mesh. To eliminate chaotic temporal interpolation artifacts, the base domain dynamically limits its timestep bounds ($\Delta t$) exactly to the fine grid's safety factor when AMR is engaged.
